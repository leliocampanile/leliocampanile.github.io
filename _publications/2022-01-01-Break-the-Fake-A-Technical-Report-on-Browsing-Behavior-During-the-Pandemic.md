 __Abstract:__ The widespread use of the internet as the main source of information for many users has led to the spread of fake news and misleading information as a side effect. The pandemic that in the last 2 years has forced us to change our lifestyle and to increase the time spent at home, has further increased the time spent surfing the Internet. In this work we analyze the navigation logs of a sample of users, in compliance with the current privacy regulation, comparing and dividing between the different categories of target sites, also identifying some well-known sites that spread fake news. The results of the report show that during the most acute periods of the pandemic there was an increase in surfing on untrusted sites. The report also shows the tendency to use such sites in the evening and night hours and highlights the differences between the different years considered. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

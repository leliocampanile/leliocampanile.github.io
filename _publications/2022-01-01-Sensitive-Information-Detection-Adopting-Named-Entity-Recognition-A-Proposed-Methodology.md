 __Abstract:__ Protecting and safeguarding privacy has become increasingly important, especially in recent years. The increasing possibilities of acquiring and sharing personal information and data through digital devices and platforms, such as apps or social networks, have increased the risks of privacy breaches. In order to effectively respect and guarantee the privacy and protection of sensitive information, it is necessary to develop mechanisms capable of providing such guarantees automatically and reliably. In this paper we propose a methodology able to automatically recognize sensitive data. A Named Entity Recognition was used to identify appropriate entities. An improvement in the recognition of these entities is achieved by evaluating the words contained in an appropriate context window by assessing their similarity to words in a domain taxonomy. This, in fact, makes it possible to refine the labels of the recognized categories using a generic Named Entity Recognition. A preliminary evaluation of the reliability of the proposed approach was performed. In detail, texts of juridical documents written in Italian were analyzed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

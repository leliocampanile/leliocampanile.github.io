 __Abstract:__ Internet of Things (IoTs) services and data-centric systems allow smart and efficient information exchanging. Anyway, even if existing IoTs and cyber security architectures are enforcing, they are still vulnerable to security issues, as unauthorized access, data breaches, intrusions. They can&apos;t provide yet sufficiently robust and secure solutions to be applied in a straightforward way, both for ensuring privacy preservation and trustworthiness of transmitted data, evenly preventing from its fraudulent and unauthorized usage. Such data potentially include critical information about persons&apos; privacy (locations, visited places, behaviors, goods, anagraphic data and health conditions). So, novel approaches for IoTs and data-centric security are needed. In this work, we address IoTs systems security problem focusing on the privacy preserving issue. Indeed, after the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy data protection is a mandatory requirement for systems producing and managing sensible users&apos; data. Starting from a case study for the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), we performed a pilot study and DPIA assessment to analyze possible mitigation strategies for improving the compliance of IoTs based systems to GDPR requirements. Our preliminary results evidenced that the introduction of blockchains in IoTs systems architectures can improve significantly the compliance to privacy regulations.

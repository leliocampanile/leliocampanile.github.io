 __Abstract:__ Internet of Things (IoT) is a well established approach used for the implementation of surveillance systems that are suitable for monitoring large portions of territory. Current developments allow the design of battery powered IoT nodes that can communicate over the network with low energy requirements and locally perform some computing and coordination task, besides running sensing and related processing: it is thus possible to implement edge computing oriented solutions on IoT, if the design encompasses both hardware and software elements in terms of sensing, processing, computing, communications and routing energy costs as one of the quality indices of the system. In this paper we propose a modeling approach for edge computing IoT-based monitoring systems energy related characteristics, suitable for the analysis of energy levels of large battery powered monitoring systems with dynamic and reactive computing workloads. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

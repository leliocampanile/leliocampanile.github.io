 __Abstract:__ The diffusion of intelligent services and the push for the integration of computing systems and services in the environment in which they operate require a constant sensing activity and the acquisition of different information from the environment and the users. Health monitoring, domotics, Industry 4.0 and environmental challenges leverage the availability of cost-effective sensing solutions that allow both the creation of knowledge bases and the automatic process of them, be it with algorithmic approaches or artificial intelligence solutions. The foundation of these solutions is given by the Internet of Things (IoT), and the substanding Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology stack. Of course, design approaches are needed that enable defining efficient and effective sensing infrastructures, including energy related aspects. In this paper we present a Domain Specific Language for the design of energy aware WSN IoT solutions, that allows domain experts to define sensor network models that may be then analyzed by simulation-based or analytic techniques to evaluate the effect of task allocation and offioading and energy harvesting and utilization in the network. The language has been designed to leverage the SIMTHESys modeling framework and its multiformalism modeling evaluation features. ©ECMS Ibrahim A.

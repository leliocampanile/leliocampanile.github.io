 __Abstract:__ Modern predictive maintenance is the convergence of several technological trends: developing new techniques and algorithms can be very costly due to the need for a physical prototype. This research has the final aim to build a simulation-based software framework for modeling and analysing complex systems and for defining predictive maintenance algorithms. By the usage of simulation, quantitative evaluation of the dependability of such systems will be possible. The ERTMS/ETCS dependability case study is presented to prove the applicability of the software. © 2020 IEEE.

 __Abstract:__ The gaseous emissions derived from industrial plants are generally subject to a strictly program of monitoring, both continuous or one-spot, in order to comply with the limits imposed by the permitting license. Nowadays the problem of odour emission, and the consequently nuisance generated to the nearest receptors, has acquired importance so that is frequently asked a specific implementation of the air pollution monitoring program. In this paper we studied the case study of a generic landfill for the implementation of the odour monitoring system and time-specific use of air pollution control technology. The off-site monitoring is based on the deployment of electronic nose as part of a specifically built WSN system. The nodes outside the landfill boundary do not act as a continuously monitoring stations but as sensors activated when specific conditions, inside and outside the landfill, are achieved. The WSN is then organized on an energy-aware approach so to prolong the lifetime of the entire system, with significant cost-benefit advancement, and produce a monitoring-structure that can answer to specific input like threshold overshooting.

 __Abstract:__ In this paper we present a modeling approach suitable for practical evaluation of the delays that may affect security monitoring systems in (multitenant) cloud based architecture, and in general to support professionals in planning and evaluating relevant parameters in dealing with new designs or migration projects. The approach is based on modularity and multiformalism techniques to manage complexity and guide designers in an incremental process, to help transferring technical knowledge into modeling practice and to help easing the use of simulation. We present a case study based on a real experience, triggered by a new legal requirement that Italian Public Administration should comply about their datacenters. © 2020 The Author(s)

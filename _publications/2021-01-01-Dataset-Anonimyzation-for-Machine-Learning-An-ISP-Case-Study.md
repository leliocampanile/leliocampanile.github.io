 __Abstract:__ Internet Service Providers technical support needs personal data to predict potential anomalies. In this paper, we performed a comparative study of forecasting performance using raw data and anonymized data, in order to assess how much performance may vary, when plain personal data are replaced by anonymized personal data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

 __Abstract:__ Smart streets promise widely available traffic information to help improve people&apos;s safety. Unfortunately, gathering that data may threaten privacy. We describe an architecture that exploits a blockchain and the Internet of Vehicles and show its compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

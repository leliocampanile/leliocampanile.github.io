 __Abstract:__ Nowadays, the problem of system robustness, es-pecially in critical infrastructures, is a challenging open question. Some systems provide crucial services continuously failing, threatening the availability of the provided services. By designing a robust architecture, this criticality could be overcome or limited, ensuring service continuity. The definition of a resilient system involves not only its architecture but also the methodology implemented for the calculation and analysis of some indices, quantifying system performance. This study provides an innovative architecture for Digital Twins implementation based on a hybrid methodology for improving the control system in realtime. The introduced approach brings together different techniques. In particular, the work combines the point of strengths of Model-based methods and Data-driven ones, aiming to improve system performances. © 2023 IEEE.

 __Abstract:__ A proper requirement definition phase is of a paramount importance in software engineering. It is the first and prime mean to realize efficient and reliable systems. System requirements are usually formulated and expressed in natural language, given its universality and ease of communication and writing. Unfortunately, natural language can be a source of ambiguity, complexity and omissions, which may cause system failures. Among the different approaches proposed by the software engineering community, Behavioural-Driven Development (BDD) is affirming as a valid, practical method to structure effective and non-ambiguous requirement specifications. The paper tackles with the problem of measuring requirements in BDD by assessing some traditional Natural Language Processing-related metrics with respect to a sample excerpt of requirement specification rewritten according to the BDD criteria. This preliminary assessment is made on the ERTMS-ETCS Level 3 case study whose specification, up to this date, is not managed by a standardisation body. The paper demonstrates the necessity of novel metrics able to cope with the BDD specification paradigms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

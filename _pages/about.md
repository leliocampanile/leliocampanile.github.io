I have a degree in computer engineering, I currently work as a tenured teacher in the Italian public high school, I worked at the University of Campania ”L. Vanvitelli” and as a freelancer for the design and development of software systems, as an administrator of linux systems and as a network systems engineer. I have a long experience as a trainer and teacher for companies and public institutions,  I taught for 3 years for the Apple Academy of Naples in foundation courses. I am a member of Italian Python Association and I am a Managing PSF (Python Software Foundation) Member. Passed the government exam and licensed as a profession engineer section A - Informatics (Computer Science), and enrolled as a member of the Italian Engineering Society;  I am member of IEEE and other scientific societies.

I collaborate for research activities with the Department of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Campania “L. Vanvitelli”, currently as a PhD student in the last year of course (waiting to defend the thesis). I have published more than 25 peer reviewed articles, including Journal, conference and book chapters and I have served as scientific conference commitee, chairman and reviewer for several scientific journal. 

My research activity is primarily focused on modeling of complex computer-based system, Wireless Sensor Network and Cyber-Physical Systems, using formal and non-formal method, with a focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques and their integration in the modeling and analysis of such systems and  and non-functional requirements such as performance, privacy and security.

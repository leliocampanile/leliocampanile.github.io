I graduated in computer engineering (master's degree). Then I worked as developer freelance. I was starting to develop in different programming language (python, java, c, c++) and as network and system administrator (linux servers and cisco, juniper and mikrotik device).

I love programming in python, and I am a member of Italian Python Association.

Actually I work at Università della Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli”; in the last year I am involved in organising iOS foundation course for my university, in collaboration with Apple, as teacher and as technical reference for that. During this experience I am learning a new way of teaching (CBL Framework) and get me to work with new people from other country.

In my career at University I worked on several project, as the fiber channel university network, the new university website (I was a webmaster of this website) and also on the new university’s data center.

I support the research activities of the research team of Mauro Iacono, actualy as PhD student.

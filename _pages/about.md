I hold a degree in Computer Engineering and I am currently an **Assistant Professor (RTD-A)** at the Department of Mathematics and Physics, Università degli Studi della Campania *Luigi Vanvitelli*.  
Previously, I worked at the same university as a professional computer scientist and also as a freelancer, focusing on the **design and development of software systems**, **Linux system administration**, and **network engineering**.  

I have a long-standing experience as a trainer and instructor for both companies and public institutions. For three years, I taught in the **Apple Developer Academy of Naples**, delivering foundation courses. I am also actively engaged in the Python community: I am a member of the Italian Python Association, a **Managing Member of the Python Software Foundation (PSF)**, and founder and organizer of [PyCampania](https://www.pycampania.it), the Python Campania community. I also contribute to the organization of [PyCon Italia](https://www.pycon.it), the flagship Python conference in Italy.

I am a licensed professional engineer, having passed the government exam for **Engineer Section A – Computer Science**, and I am a member of the **Italian Engineering Society**. I am also an active member of **IEEE** and other scientific societies.

## Research

My research is primarily focused on the **modeling of complex computer-based systems**, including **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)** and **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**, using both formal and non-formal methods.  
I investigate the integration of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques into modeling and analysis, with particular attention to **non-functional requirements** such as **performance, privacy, and security**.  

I regularly publish peer-reviewed work, including journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters. I also serve as **reviewer, committee member, and session chair** in several international conferences and scientific journals.

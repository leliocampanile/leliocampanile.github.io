abstract={Blockchain technologies and distributed ledgers enable the design and implementation of trustable data logging systems that can be used by multiple parties to produce a non-repudiable database. The case of Internet of Vehicles may greatly benefit of such a possibility to track the chain of responsibility in case of accidents or damages due to bad or omitted maintenance, improving the safety of circulation and helping granting a correct handling of related legal issues. However, there are privacy issues that have to be considered, as tracked information potentially include data about private persons (position, personal habits), commercially relevant information (state of the fleet of a company, freight movement and related planning, logistic strategies), or even more critical knowledge (e.g., considering vehicles belonging to police, public authorities, governments or officers in sensible positions). In the European Union, all this information is covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper we propose a reference model for a system that manages relevant information to show how blockchain can support GDPR compliant solutions for Internet of Vehicles, taking as a reference an integrated scenario based on Italy, and analyze a subset of its use cases to show its viability with reference to privacy issues. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The COVID-19 emergency suddenly obliged schools and universities around the world to deliver on-line lectures and services. While the urgency of response resulted in a fast and massive adoption of standard, public on-line platforms, generally owned by big players in the digital services market, this does not sufficiently take into account privacy-related and security-related issues and potential legal problems about the legitimate exploitation of the intellectual rights about contents. However, the experience brought to attention a vast set of issues, which have been addressed by implementing these services by means of private platforms. This work presents a modeling and evaluation framework, defined on a set of high-level, management-oriented parameters and based on a Vectorial Auto Regressive Fractional (Integrated) Moving Average based approach, to support the design of distance learning architectures. The purpose of this framework is to help decision makers to evaluate the requirements and the costs of hybrid cloud technology solutions. Furthermore, it aims at providing a coarse grain reference organization integrating low-cost, long-term storage management services to implement a viable and accessible history feature for all materials. The proposed solution has been designed bearing in mind the ecosystem of Italian universities. A realistic case study has been shaped on the needs of an important, generalist, polycentric Italian university, where some of the authors of this paper work. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Advances in technology and the rise of new computing paradigms, such as Fog computing, may boost the definition of a new generation of advanced support services in critical applications. In this paper we explore the possibilities of a Wireless Sensor Network support (WSN) for a Fog computing system in an emergency management architecture that has been previously presented. Disposable intelligent wireless sensors, capable of processing tasks locally, are deployed and used to support and protect the intervention of a squad of firemen equipped with augmented reality and life monitoring devices to provide an environmental monitoring system and communication infrastructure,in the framework of a next-generation, cloud-supported emergency management system. Simulation is used to explore the design parameter space and dimension the workloads and the extension of the WSN, according to an adaptive behavior of the resulting Fog computing system that varies workloads to save the integrity of the WSN. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Complexity of current computer networks, including e.g., local networks, large structured networks, wireless sensor networks, datacenter backbones, requires a thorough study to perform analysis and support design. Simulation is a tool of paramount importance to encompass all the different aspects that contribute to design quality and network performance (including as well energy issues, security management overheads, dependability), due to the fact that such complexity produces several interactions at all network layers that is not easily modellable with analytic approaches. In this systematic literature review we aim to analyze, basing our investigation on available literature, the adoption of a popular network simulator, namely ns-3, and its use in the scientific community. More in detail, we are interested in understanding what are the impacted application domains in which authors prefer ns-3 to other similar tools and how extensible it is in practice according to the experience of authors. The results of our analysis, which has been conducted by especially focusing on 128 papers published between 2009 to 2019, reveals that 10% of the evaluated papers were discarded because they represented informal literature; most of the studies presented comparisons among different network simulators, beyond ns-3 and conceptual studies related to performance assessment and validation and routing protocols. Only about 30% of considered studies present extensions of ns-3 in terms of new modules and only about 10% present effective case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of employing network simulator in real application, except conceptual and modeling studies. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Technological development and market expansion offer an increased availability of resources and computing power on IoT nodes at affordable cost. The edge computing paradigm allows keeping locally on the edge of the network a part of computing, while keeping all advantages of the cloud and adding support for privacy, real-time and network resilience. This can be further improved in IoT applications by flexibly harvesting resources on IoT nodes, by moving part of the computing tasks related to data from the edge server to the nodes, raising the abstraction level of the data aspects of the architecture and potentially enabling larger IoT networks to be efficiently deployed and managed, in a stand-alone logic or as a component of edge architecture. Anyway, an efficient energy management mechanism is needed for battery powered IoT networks, the most flexible implementations, that dynamically balances task allocation and execution in order to In this paper we present a fuzzy logic based power management strategy for IoT subsystem that aims at maximizing the duration of the network by locally migrating part of the computing tasks between nodes. As our goal is to enable the deployment of semi-autonomic large IoT networks, our proposal does not rely on external resources for migration control and operates on a local basis to ensure scalability: at the best of our knowledge, this diferentiates our proposal with respect to similar solutions available in literature. © 2020, IICM.

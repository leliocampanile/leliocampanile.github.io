	abstract = {The widespread use of the internet as the main source of information for many users has led to the spread of fake news and misleading information as a side effect. The pandemic that in the last 2 years has forced us to change our lifestyle and to increase the time spent at home, has further increased the time spent surfing the Internet. In this work we analyze the navigation logs of a sample of users, in compliance with the current privacy regulation, comparing and dividing between the different categories of target sites, also identifying some well-known sites that spread fake news. The results of the report show that during the most acute periods of the pandemic there was an increase in surfing on untrusted sites. The report also shows the tendency to use such sites in the evening and night hours and highlights the differences between the different years considered. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 emergency suddenly obliged schools and universities around the world to deliver on-line lectures and services. While the urgency of response resulted in a fast and massive adoption of standard, public on-line platforms, generally owned by big players in the digital services market, this does not sufficiently take into account privacy-related and security-related issues and potential legal problems about the legitimate exploitation of the intellectual rights about contents. However, the experience brought to attention a vast set of issues, which have been addressed by implementing these services by means of private platforms. This work presents a modeling and evaluation framework, defined on a set of high-level, management-oriented parameters and based on a Vectorial Auto Regressive Fractional (Integrated) Moving Average based approach, to support the design of distance learning architectures. The purpose of this framework is to help decision makers to evaluate the requirements and the costs of hybrid cloud technology solutions. Furthermore, it aims at providing a coarse grain reference organization integrating low-cost, long-term storage management services to implement a viable and accessible history feature for all materials. The proposed solution has been designed bearing in mind the ecosystem of Italian universities. A realistic case study has been shaped on the needs of an important, generalist, polycentric Italian university, where some of the authors of this paper work. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies and distributed ledgers enable the design and implementation of trustable data logging systems that can be used by multiple parties to produce a non-repudiable database. The case of Internet of Vehicles may greatly benefit of such a possibility to track the chain of responsibility in case of accidents or damages due to bad or omitted maintenance, improving the safety of circulation and helping granting a correct handling of related legal issues. However, there are privacy issues that have to be considered, as tracked information potentially include data about private persons (position, personal habits), commercially relevant information (state of the fleet of a company, freight movement and related planning, logistic strategies), or even more critical knowledge (e.g., considering vehicles belonging to police, public authorities, governments or officers in sensible positions). In the European Union, all this information is covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper we propose a reference model for a system that manages relevant information to show how blockchain can support GDPR compliant solutions for Internet of Vehicles, taking as a reference an integrated scenario based on Italy, and analyze a subset of its use cases to show its viability with reference to privacy issues. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

While the privacy community stated proper risk assessment and mitigation approaches to be applied, literature seems to suggest that the software engineering community, with special reference to companies, did actually concentrate on the specification phase, with less attention for the test phase of products. In coherence with the privacy-by-design approach, we believe that a bigger methodological effort must be put in the systematic adaptation of software development cycles to privacy regulations, and that this effort might be promoted in the industrial community by focusing on the relation between organizational costs vs technical features, also leveraging the benefits of targeted testing as a mean to lower operational privacy enforcement costs.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In order to not develop strict measures and to better manage territories, the national authorities have applied a vast range of predictive models. Actually, the application of machine learning has been studied in the last decades in various cases with various declination to simplify this problem. In this paper, we apply a regression-based analysis technique to a dataset containing official historical local pollution and weather data to look for criteria that allow forecasting critical conditions. The methods was applied to the case study of Napoli, Italy, where the local environmental protection agency manages a set of fixed monitoring stations where both chemical and meteorological data are recorded. The joining of the two raw dataset was overcome by the use of a maximum inclusion strategy as performing the joining action with”outer” mode. Among the four different regression models applied, namely the Linear Regression Model calculated with Ordinary Least Square (LN-OLS), the Ridge regression Model (Ridge), the Lasso Model (Lasso) and Supervised Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), the Ridge regression model was found to better perform with an R2 (Coefficient of Determination) value equal to 0.77 and low value for both MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error), equal to 0.12 and 0.04 respectively. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {Modern warehouse-scale computing facilities, seamlessly enabled by virtualisation technologies, are based on thousands of independent computing nodes that are administered according to efficiency criteria that depend on workload. Networks play a pivotal role in these systems, as they are likely to be the performance bottleneck, and because of the high variability of data and management traffic. Because of the scale of the system, the prevalent network management model is based on autonomic networking, a paradigm based on self-regulation of the networking subsystem, that requires routers capable of adapting their policies to traffic by a local or global strategy. In this paper we focus on performance modelling of autonomic routers, to provide a simple, yet representative elementary performance model to provide a starting point for a comprehensive autonomic network modelling approach. The proposed model is used to evaluate the behaviour of a router under attack under realistic workload and parameters assumptions. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Nowadays the problem of odour emission, and the consequently nuisance generated to the nearest receptors, has acquired importance so that is frequently asked a specific implementation of the air pollution monitoring program. In this paper we studied the case study of a generic landfill for the implementation of the odour monitoring system and time-specific use of air pollution control technology. The off-site monitoring is based on the deployment of electronic nose as part of a specifically built WSN system. The nodes outside the landfill boundary do not act as a continuously monitoring stations but as sensors activated when specific conditions, inside and outside the landfill, are achieved. The WSN is then organized on an energy-aware approach so to prolong the lifetime of the entire system, with significant cost-benefit advancement, and produce a monitoring-structure that can answer to specific input like threshold overshooting.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoTs) services and data-centric systems allow smart and efficient information exchanging. Anyway, even if existing IoTs and cyber security architectures are enforcing, they are still vulnerable to security issues, as unauthorized access, data breaches, intrusions. They can't provide yet sufficiently robust and secure solutions to be applied in a straightforward way, both for ensuring privacy preservation and trustworthiness of transmitted data, evenly preventing from its fraudulent and unauthorized usage. Such data potentially include critical information about persons' privacy (locations, visited places, behaviors, goods, anagraphic data and health conditions). So, novel approaches for IoTs and data-centric security are needed. In this work, we address IoTs systems security problem focusing on the privacy preserving issue. Indeed, after the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy data protection is a mandatory requirement for systems producing and managing sensible users' data. Starting from a case study for the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), we performed a pilot study and DPIA assessment to analyze possible mitigation strategies for improving the compliance of IoTs based systems to GDPR requirements. Our preliminary results evidenced that the introduction of blockchains in IoTs systems architectures can improve significantly the compliance to privacy regulations.

Cost effectiveness is a direct consequence of a correct estimation of resource usage, to be able to define a budget and estimate the right price to put own services on the market. Attacks that overload resources with non legitimate requests, being them explicit attacks or just malicious, non harmful resource engagements, may push the use of Cloud resources beyond estimation, causing additional costs, or unexpected energy usage, or a lower overall quality of services, so intrusion detection devices or firewalls are set to avoid undesired accesses. We propose the use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to setup a method for shaping request based attacks capable of reaching resources beyond defenses. The approach is studied by using a publicly available traffic data set, to test the concept and demonstrate its potential applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the problem of system robustness, es-pecially in critical infrastructures, is a challenging open question. Some systems provide crucial services continuously failing, threatening the availability of the provided services. By designing a robust architecture, this criticality could be overcome or limited, ensuring service continuity. The definition of a resilient system involves not only its architecture but also the methodology implemented for the calculation and analysis of some indices, quantifying system performance. This study provides an innovative architecture for Digital Twins implementation based on a hybrid methodology for improving the control system in realtime. The introduced approach brings together different techniques. In particular, the work combines the point of strengths of Model-based methods and Data-driven ones, aiming to improve system performances.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Technological development and market expansion offer an increased availability of resources and computing power on IoT nodes at affordable cost. The edge computing paradigm allows keeping locally on the edge of the network a part of computing, while keeping all advantages of the cloud and adding support for privacy, real-time and network resilience. This can be further improved in IoT applications by flexibly harvesting resources on IoT nodes, by moving part of the computing tasks related to data from the edge server to the nodes, raising the abstraction level of the data aspects of the architecture and potentially enabling larger IoT networks to be efficiently deployed and managed, in a stand-alone logic or as a component of edge architecture. Anyway, an efficient energy management mechanism is needed for battery powered IoT networks, the most flexible implementations, that dynamically balances task allocation and execution in order to In this paper we present a fuzzy logic based power management strategy for IoT subsystem that aims at maximizing the duration of the network by locally migrating part of the computing tasks between nodes. As our goal is to enable the deployment of semi-autonomic large IoT networks, our proposal does not rely on external resources for migration control and operates on a local basis to ensure scalability: at the best of our knowledge, this diferentiates our proposal with respect to similar solutions available in literature. © 2020, IICM.

	abstract = {Misinformation and Fake News are hard to dislodge. According to experts on this phenomenon, to fight disinformation a less credulous public is needed; so, current AI techniques can support misleading information debunking, given the human tendency to believe “facts” that confirm biases. Much effort has been recently spent by the research community on this plague: several AI-based approaches for automatic detection and classification of Fake News have been proposed; unfortunately, Fake News producers have refined their ability in eluding automatic ML and DL-based detection systems. So, debunking false news represents an effective weapon to contrast the users’ reliance on false information. In this work, we propose a preliminary study aiming to approach the design of effective fake news debunking systems, harnessing two complementary federated approaches. We propose, firstly, a federation of independent classification systems to accomplish a debunking process, by applying a distributed consensus mechanism. Secondly, a federated learning task, involving several cooperating nodes, is accomplished, to obtain a unique merged model, including features of single participants models, trained on different and independent data fragments. This study is a preliminary work aiming to to point out the feasibility and the comparability of these proposed approaches, thus paving the way to an experimental campaign that will be performed on effective real data, thus providing an evidence for an effective and feasible model for detecting potential heterogeneous fake news. Debunking misleading information is mission critical to increase the awareness of facts on the part of news consumers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {A proper requirement definition phase is of a paramount importance in software engineering. It is the first and prime mean to realize efficient and reliable systems. System requirements are usually formulated and expressed in natural language, given its universality and ease of communication and writing. Unfortunately, natural language can be a source of ambiguity, complexity and omissions, which may cause system failures. Among the different approaches proposed by the software engineering community, Behavioural-Driven Development (BDD) is affirming as a valid, practical method to structure effective and non-ambiguous requirement specifications. The paper tackles with the problem of measuring requirements in BDD by assessing some traditional Natural Language Processing-related metrics with respect to a sample excerpt of requirement specification rewritten according to the BDD criteria. This preliminary assessment is made on the ERTMS-ETCS Level 3 case study whose specification, up to this date, is not managed by a standardisation body. The paper demonstrates the necessity of novel metrics able to cope with the BDD specification paradigms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being recently explored also to its application in supporting malicious activities and objects detection. Furthermore, NLP and Deep Learning have become targets of malicious attacks too. Very recent researches evidenced that adversarial attacks are able to affect also NLP tasks, in addition to the more popular adversarial attacks on deep learning systems for image processing tasks. More precisely, while small perturbations applied to the data set adopted for training typical NLP tasks (e.g., Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, etc..) could be easily recognized, models poisoning, performed by the means of altered data models, typically provided in the transfer learning phase to a deep neural networks (e.g., poisoning attacks by word embeddings), are harder to be detected. In this work, we preliminary explore the effectiveness of a poisoned word embeddings attack aimed at a deep neural network trained to accomplish a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. By adopting the NER case study, we aimed to analyze the severity of such a kind of attack to accuracy in recognizing the right classes for the given entities. Finally, this study represents a preliminary step to assess the impact and the vulnerabilities of some NLP systems we adopt in our research activities, and further investigating some potential mitigation strategies, in order to make these systems more resilient to data and models poisoning attacks. © 2021 The Authors.

While application of artificial intelligence based solutions is largely advocated by researchers in several fields of chemical engineering to face the problems deriving from these practices, few actual cases exist in literature and in industrial plants that leverage currently available tools as much as other application fields suggest. One of the factors that is limiting the spread of AI-based solutions in the field is the lack of tools that support the evaluation of the needs of plants, be those existing or to-be settlements.

The study is based on the reconstruction of an extensive dataset from one-year continuous monitoring of the scrubber's performances and operating conditions. The dataset has been interpreted with a conventional analytical, physical-mathematical, model for absorbers' rating and its combination with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) one. First, the analytical model has been used to provide a deterministic mathematical framework for the interpretation and the prediction of the scrubber's performances in terms of absorbed SO2 molar flow and SO2 concentration at the scrubber exit. Then, data mining and AI techniques have been applied to develop an Artificial Neural Network able to predict the error between the actual SO2 concentration at the scrubber exit and the corresponding analytical model predictions. The final result is a combined model providing superior robustness and accuracy in the prediction of the scrubber performance while preserving a rationale for process design and operation. This interesting outcome suggests that the development of combined, or hybrid, Analytical/AI models can be a reliable and cost-effective way to improve chemical engineers' ability to design and control marine scrubbers, as well as other chemical equipment. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Modern environmental regulations require rigorous optimization of operations in process engineering to reduce waste, pollution, and risks while maximizing efficiency. However, the nature of chemical plants, which include components with non-linear behavior, challenges the use of consolidated tuning and control techniques. Instead, ad-hoc, self-adapting, and time-variant controls, with a balanced tuning of parameters at both the subsystem and system level, may be necessary. Needed computing processes may require significant resources and high performance systems, if managed by means of traditional approaches and with exact solution methods. In this regard, domain experts suggest instead the use of integrated techniques based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which include Explainable AI (XAI) and Trustworthy AI (TAI), which are unique in this industry and still in the early stages of development. To pave the way for a real-time, cost-effective solution for this problem, this paper proposes an AI-based approach to model the performance of a real chemical plant, i.e. a marine scrubber installed on a Ro-Ro ship. The study aims to investigate Machine Learning (ML) techniques which can be used to model such processes. Notably, this analysis is the first of its kind, at the best of the authors’ knowledge. Overall, the study highlights the potential of using ML-based techniques, to optimize environmental compliance in the shipping industry. © ECMS Enrico Vicario, Romeo Bandinelli, Virginia Fani, Michele Mastroianni (Editors) 2023.},

We set up a text classification model for AA based on stylometry exploiting recurrent deep neural networks and implemented two learning tasks trained on the same collection of fake and real news, comparing their performances: one is based on Federated Learning architecture, the other on a centralized architecture. The goal was to discriminate potential fake information from true ones when the fake news comes from heterogeneous sources, with different styles. Preliminary experiments show that a distributed approach significantly improves recall with respect to the centralized model. As expected, precision was lower in the distributed model.

Health monitoring, domotics, Industry 4.0 and environmental challenges leverage the availability of cost-effective sensing solutions that allow both the creation of knowledge bases and the automatic process of them, be it with algorithmic approaches or artificial intelligence solutions. The foundation of these solutions is given by the Internet of Things (IoT), and the substanding Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology stack. Of course, design approaches are needed that enable defining efficient and effective sensing infrastructures, including energy related aspects. In this paper we present a Domain Specific Language for the design of energy aware WSN IoT solutions, that allows domain experts to define sensor network models that may be then analyzed by simulation-based or analytic techniques to evaluate the effect of task allocation and offioading and energy harvesting and utilization in the network. The language has been designed to leverage the SIMTHESys modeling framework and its multiformalism modeling evaluation features. ©ECMS Ibrahim A.

Unfortunately, the literature reports that IoT devices, a widely adopted technology for these applications, are characterized by security vulnerabilities that are difficult to manage at the state level. Comparable problems exist for related technologies that leverage smartphones, such as contact tracing applications, and non-medical health monitoring devices. In analogous situations, these vulnerabilities may be exploited in the cyber domain to overload the crisis management systems with false alarms and to interfere with the interests of target countries, with consequences on their economy and their political equilibria.

	abstract = {Complexity of current computer networks, including e.g., local networks, large structured networks, wireless sensor networks, datacenter backbones, requires a thorough study to perform analysis and support design. Simulation is a tool of paramount importance to encompass all the different aspects that contribute to design quality and network performance (including as well energy issues, security management overheads, dependability), due to the fact that such complexity produces several interactions at all network layers that is not easily modellable with analytic approaches. In this systematic literature review we aim to analyze, basing our investigation on available literature, the adoption of a popular network simulator, namely ns-3, and its use in the scientific community. More in detail, we are interested in understanding what are the impacted application domains in which authors prefer ns-3 to other similar tools and how extensible it is in practice according to the experience of authors. The results of our analysis, which has been conducted by especially focusing on 128 papers published between 2009 to 2019, reveals that 10% of the evaluated papers were discarded because they represented informal literature; most of the studies presented comparisons among different network simulators, beyond ns-3 and conceptual studies related to performance assessment and validation and routing protocols. Only about 30% of considered studies present extensions of ns-3 in terms of new modules and only about 10% present effective case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of employing network simulator in real application, except conceptual and modeling studies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Modern networking is moving towards exploitation of autonomic features into networks to reduce management effort and compensate the increasing complexity of network infrastructures, e.g. in large computing facilities such the data centers that support cloud services delivery. Autonomicity provides the possibility of reacting to anomalies in network traffic by recognizing them and applying administrator defined reactions without the need for human intervention, obtaining a quicker response and easier adaptation to network dynamics, and letting administrators focus on general system-wide policies, rather than on each component of the infrastructure. The process of defining proper policies may benefit from adopting model-based design cycles, to get an estimation of their effects. In this paper we propose a model-based analysis approach of a simple autonomic router, using Stochastic Petri Nets, to evaluate the behavior of given policies designed to react to traffic workloads. The approach allows a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the policy and is suitable to be used in the preliminary phases of the design cycle for a Software Defined Networks compliant router control plane. ©ECMS Mauro Iacono, Francesco Palmieri, Marco Gribaudo, Massimo Ficco (Editors).},

In healthcare, especially, where large amounts of quantitative and qualitative data are transferred to support studies and early diagnosis and monitoring of any diseases, potential security and privacy issues cannot be underestimated. Federated learning is an approach where privacy issues related to sensitive data management can be significantly reduced, due to the possibility to train algorithms without exchanging data. The main idea behind this approach is that learning models can be trained in a distributed way, where multiple devices or servers with decentralized data samples can provide their contributions without having to exchange their local data. Recent studies provided evidence that prototypes trained by adopting Federated Learning strategies are able to achieve reliable performance, thus by generating robust models without sharing data and, consequently, limiting the impact on security and privacy.

The increasing possibilities of acquiring and sharing personal information and data through digital devices and platforms, such as apps or social networks, have increased the risks of privacy breaches. In order to effectively respect and guarantee the privacy and protection of sensitive information, it is necessary to develop mechanisms capable of providing such guarantees automatically and reliably. In this paper we propose a methodology able to automatically recognize sensitive data. A Named Entity Recognition was used to identify appropriate entities. An improvement in the recognition of these entities is achieved by evaluating the words contained in an appropriate context window by assessing their similarity to words in a domain taxonomy. This, in fact, makes it possible to refine the labels of the recognized categories using a generic Named Entity Recognition. A preliminary evaluation of the reliability of the proposed approach was performed.

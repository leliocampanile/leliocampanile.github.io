abstract={Modern predictive maintenance is the convergence of several technological trends: developing new techniques and algorithms can be very costly due to the need for a physical prototype. This research has the final aim to build a simulation-based software framework for modeling and analysing complex systems and for defining predictive maintenance algorithms. By the usage of simulation, quantitative evaluation of the dependability of such systems will be possible. The ERTMS/ETCS dependability case study is presented to prove the applicability of the software. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN) are one of the ways to provide the communication infrastructure for advanced applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. IoT supports high level applications over WSN to provide services in a number of fields. WSN are also suitable to support critical applications, as the supporting technologies are consolidated and standard network services can be used on top of the specific layers. Furthermore, generic distributed or network-enabled software can be run over the nodes of a WSN. In this paper we evaluate and compare performances of IEEE 802.llg and 802.1 In, two implementations of the popular Wi-Fi technology, to support the deployment and utilization of an energy management support system, used to monitor the field by a team of firefighters during a mission. Evaluation on an example scenario is done by using ns-3, an open network simulator characterized by its realistic details, to understand the actual limitations of the two standards besides theoretical limits. © ECMS Mike Steglich, Christian Mueller, Gaby Neumann, Mathias Walther.},

abstract={The gaseous emissions derived from industrial plants are generally subject to a strictly program of monitoring, both continuous or one-spot, in order to comply with the limits imposed by the permitting license. Nowadays the problem of odour emission, and the consequently nuisance generated to the nearest receptors, has acquired importance so that is frequently asked a specific implementation of the air pollution monitoring program. In this paper we studied the case study of a generic landfill for the implementation of the odour monitoring system and time-specific use of air pollution control technology. The off-site monitoring is based on the deployment of electronic nose as part of a specifically built WSN system. The nodes outside the landfill boundary do not act as a continuously monitoring stations but as sensors activated when specific conditions, inside and outside the landfill, are achieved. The WSN is then organized on an energy-aware approach so to prolong the lifetime of the entire system, with significant cost-benefit advancement, and produce a monitoring-structure that can answer to specific input like threshold overshooting.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoTs) services and data-centric systems allow smart and efficient information exchanging. Anyway, even if existing IoTs and cyber security architectures are enforcing, they are still vulnerable to security issues, as unauthorized access, data breaches, intrusions. They can't provide yet sufficiently robust and secure solutions to be applied in a straightforward way, both for ensuring privacy preservation and trustworthiness of transmitted data, evenly preventing from its fraudulent and unauthorized usage. Such data potentially include critical information about persons' privacy (locations, visited places, behaviors, goods, anagraphic data and health conditions). So, novel approaches for IoTs and data-centric security are needed. In this work, we address IoTs systems security problem focusing on the privacy preserving issue. Indeed, after the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy data protection is a mandatory requirement for systems producing and managing sensible users' data. Starting from a case study for the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), we performed a pilot study and DPIA assessment to analyze possible mitigation strategies for improving the compliance of IoTs based systems to GDPR requirements. Our preliminary results evidenced that the introduction of blockchains in IoTs systems architectures can improve significantly the compliance to privacy regulations.

abstract={Modern warehouse-scale computing facilities, seamlessly enabled by virtualisation technologies, are based on thousands of independent computing nodes that are administered according to efficiency criteria that depend on workload. Networks play a pivotal role in these systems, as they are likely to be the performance bottleneck, and because of the high variability of data and management traffic. Because of the scale of the system, the prevalent network management model is based on autonomic networking, a paradigm based on self-regulation of the networking subsystem, that requires routers capable of adapting their policies to traffic by a local or global strategy. In this paper we focus on performance modelling of autonomic routers, to provide a simple, yet representative elementary performance model to provide a starting point for a comprehensive autonomic network modelling approach. The proposed model is used to evaluate the behaviour of a router under attack under realistic workload and parameters assumptions. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Diabetes is among the most common chronic illness in the world for which often is still challenging do an early detection and a correct classification of type of diabetes to an individual. In fact it often depends on the circumstances present at the time of diagnosis, and many diabetic individuals do not easily fit into a single class. The aim is this paper is the application of ML techniques in order to classify the occurrence of different mellitus diabetes on the base of clinical data obtained from diabetic patients during the daily hospitals activities.

abstract={The role of remote resources, such as the ones provided by Cloud infrastructures, is of paramount importance for the implementation of cost effective, yet reliable software systems to provide services to third parties. Cost effectiveness is a direct consequence of a correct estimation of resource usage, to be able to define a budget and estimate the right price to put own services on the market. Attacks that overload resources with non legitimate requests, being them explicit attacks or just malicious, non harmful resource engagements, may push the use of Cloud resources beyond estimation, causing additional costs, or unexpected energy usage, or a lower overall quality of services, so intrusion detection devices or firewalls are set to avoid undesired accesses. We propose the use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to setup a method for shaping request based attacks capable of reaching resources beyond defenses. The approach is studied by using a publicly available traffic data set, to test the concept and demonstrate its potential applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Modern networking is moving towards exploitation of autonomic features into networks to reduce management effort and compensate the increasing complexity of network infrastructures, e.g. in large computing facilities such the data centers that support cloud services delivery. Autonomicity provides the possibility of reacting to anomalies in network traffic by recognizing them and applying administrator defined reactions without the need for human intervention, obtaining a quicker response and easier adaptation to network dynamics, and letting administrators focus on general system-wide policies, rather than on each component of the infrastructure. The process of defining proper policies may benefit from adopting model-based design cycles, to get an estimation of their effects. In this paper we propose a model-based analysis approach of a simple autonomic router, using Stochastic Petri Nets, to evaluate the behavior of given policies designed to react to traffic workloads. The approach allows a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the policy and is suitable to be used in the preliminary phases of the design cycle for a Software Defined Networks compliant router control plane. ©ECMS Mauro Iacono, Francesco Palmieri, Marco Gribaudo, Massimo Ficco (Editors).},

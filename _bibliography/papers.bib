abstract = {The rapid adoption of automated airport check-in systems using facial recognition raises significant privacy concerns due to their reliance on centralized deep learning models that store and transmit biometric data from edge devices. While Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for privacy preservation, its effectiveness in biometric identification remains underexplored, particularly in real-world environments like airports. This study assesses the privacy implications of FL in facial recognition by comparing three architectures. A first centralized system, where biometric data is sent to a central server for model training and inference, posing significant privacy risks. The second is a one-level FL architecture, where biometric data remains on local devices, and only model updates are shared with a central aggregator. The third is a two-level FL architecture, introducing an additional aggregation layer among airlines to enhance model generalization while preserving privacy. To ensure a rigorous privacy preservation evaluation, we integrate both quantitative and qualitative metrics. For the quantitative assessment, we leverage the Privacy Meter Tool, which enables simulations of Membership Inference Attacks and the application of Differential Privacy as a mitigation technique. For the qualitative evaluation, we conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment to analyze potential privacy risks from a regulatory perspective. Additionally, we assess model accuracy, computational efficiency, and communication overhead to determine FL’s feasibility in large-scale airport environments. Our results show that while FL significantly reduces privacy risks, the two-level FL approach introduces new vulnerabilities, such as model poisoning risks and privacy-utility trade-offs, requiring further mitigation strategies like DP.}

	abstract = {Automatic authorship analysis, often referred to as stylometry, is a captivating yet contentious field that employs computational techniques to determine the authorship of textual artefacts. In recent years, the importance of author profiling has grown significantly due to the proliferation of automatic text generation systems. These include both early-generation bots and the latest generative AI-based models, which have heightened concerns about misinformation and content authenticity. This study proposes a novel approach to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of contemporary distributed learning methods. The approach leverages the computational advantages of distributed systems while preserving the privacy of human contributors, enabling the collection and analysis of extensive datasets of “human-written” texts in contrast to those generated by bots. More specifically, the proposed method adopts a Federated Learning (FL) framework, integrating readability and stylometric metrics to deliver a privacy-preserving solution for Authorship Attribution (AA). The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of AA processes, thus achieving a more robust “authorial fingerprint”. Experimental results reveal that while FL effectively protects privacy and mitigates data exposure risks, the combined use of readability and stylometric features significantly increases the accuracy of AA. This approach demonstrates promise for secure and scalable AA applications, particularly in privacy-sensitive contexts and real-time edge computing scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

While the urgency of response resulted in a fast and massive adoption of standard, public on-line platforms, generally owned by big players in the digital services market, this does not sufficiently take into account privacy-related and security-related issues and potential legal problems about the legitimate exploitation of the intellectual rights about contents. However, the experience brought to attention a vast set of issues, which have been addressed by implementing these services by means of private platforms. This work presents a modeling and evaluation framework, defined on a set of high-level, management-oriented parameters and based on a Vectorial Auto Regressive Fractional (Integrated) Moving Average based approach, to support the design of distance learning architectures. The purpose of this framework is to help decision makers to evaluate the requirements and the costs of hybrid cloud technology solutions. Furthermore, it aims at providing a coarse grain reference organization integrating low-cost, long-term storage management services to implement a viable and accessible history feature for all materials. The proposed solution has been designed bearing in mind the ecosystem of Italian universities. A realistic case study has been shaped on the needs of an important, generalist, polycentric Italian university, where some of the authors of this paper work. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The case of Internet of Vehicles may greatly benefit of such a possibility to track the chain of responsibility in case of accidents or damages due to bad or omitted maintenance, improving the safety of circulation and helping granting a correct handling of related legal issues. However, there are privacy issues that have to be considered, as tracked information potentially include data about private persons (position, personal habits), commercially relevant information (state of the fleet of a company, freight movement and related planning, logistic strategies), or even more critical knowledge (e.g., considering vehicles belonging to police, public authorities, governments or officers in sensible positions). In the European Union, all this information is covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper we propose a reference model for a system that manages relevant information to show how blockchain can support GDPR compliant solutions for Internet of Vehicles, taking as a reference an integrated scenario based on Italy, and analyze a subset of its use cases to show its viability with reference to privacy issues. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays, nuclear technologies are increasingly being integrated into industry, healthcare and manufacturing. As a side effect, waste materials are produced according to standard processes which are subject to international regulations. One of the most critical phases is the pre-disposal, due to the uncertainty related to the evolution of the materials and their potential impact on environmental protection. This paper introduces the architecture of a monitoring system able to accomplish safety goals and to guarantee energetic sustainability. The possibility of defining different system configurations (e. g., sensor scheduling policies, geometry of the sites, trustworthiness of the sensors) fosters a high adaptability to several monitoring scenarios, being characterised by different safety and sustainability levels. A methodology, integrating a model-based approach with data collection and processing, is proposed to quantitatively evaluate system configurations. This methodology is based on the definition of two metrics — one for safety and one for sustainability — and an assessment model. The model computes the metrics considering geometry of the place, scheduling and trustworthiness of monitoring sensors. This is a first step in the construction of a Decision Support System able to aid human operators in assessing system configurations and finding possible safety/sustainability trade-offs. A case study is used to show the feasibility of the approach: some configurations are evaluated on the real plant, placed at Řež in the Czech Republic, assessing them on the base of the defined metrics. © 2025 The Authors.},

Networks play a pivotal role in these systems, as they are likely to be the performance bottleneck, and because of the high variability of data and management traffic. Because of the scale of the system, the prevalent network management model is based on autonomic networking, a paradigm based on self-regulation of the networking subsystem, that requires routers capable of adapting their policies to traffic by a local or global strategy. In this paper we focus on performance modelling of autonomic routers, to provide a simple, yet representative elementary performance model to provide a starting point for a comprehensive autonomic network modelling approach. The proposed model is used to evaluate the behaviour of a router under attack under realistic workload and parameters assumptions. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

In this paper we studied the case study of a generic landfill for the implementation of the odour monitoring system and time-specific use of air pollution control technology. The off-site monitoring is based on the deployment of electronic nose as part of a specifically built WSN system. The nodes outside the landfill boundary do not act as a continuously monitoring stations but as sensors activated when specific conditions, inside and outside the landfill, are achieved. The WSN is then organized on an energy-aware approach so to prolong the lifetime of the entire system, with significant cost-benefit advancement, and produce a monitoring-structure that can answer to specific input like threshold overshooting.

Anyway, even if existing IoTs and cyber security architectures are enforcing, they are still vulnerable to security issues, as unauthorized access, data breaches, intrusions. They can't provide yet sufficiently robust and secure solutions to be applied in a straightforward way, both for ensuring privacy preservation and trustworthiness of transmitted data, evenly preventing from its fraudulent and unauthorized usage. Such data potentially include critical information about persons' privacy (locations, visited places, behaviors, goods, anagraphic data and health conditions). So, novel approaches for IoTs and data-centric security are needed. In this work, we address IoTs systems security problem focusing on the privacy preserving issue. Indeed, after the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy data protection is a mandatory requirement for systems producing and managing sensible users' data. Starting from a case study for the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), we performed a pilot study and DPIA assessment to analyze possible mitigation strategies for improving the compliance of IoTs based systems to GDPR requirements. Our preliminary results evidenced that the introduction of blockchains in IoTs systems architectures can improve significantly the compliance to privacy regulations.

	abstract = {Technological development and market expansion offer an increased availability of resources and computing power on IoT nodes at affordable cost. The edge computing paradigm allows keeping locally on the edge of the network a part of computing, while keeping all advantages of the cloud and adding support for privacy, real-time and network resilience. This can be further improved in IoT applications by flexibly harvesting resources on IoT nodes, by moving part of the computing tasks related to data from the edge server to the nodes, raising the abstraction level of the data aspects of the architecture and potentially enabling larger IoT networks to be efficiently deployed and managed, in a stand-alone logic or as a component of edge architecture. Anyway, an efficient energy management mechanism is needed for battery powered IoT networks, the most flexible implementations, that dynamically balances task allocation and execution in order to In this paper we present a fuzzy logic based power management strategy for IoT subsystem that aims at maximizing the duration of the network by locally migrating part of the computing tasks between nodes. As our goal is to enable the deployment of semi-autonomic large IoT networks, our proposal does not rely on external resources for migration control and operates on a local basis to ensure scalability: at the best of our knowledge, this diferentiates our proposal with respect to similar solutions available in literature. © 2020, IICM.

	abstract = {In recent years, the proliferation of synthetic data generation techniques-driven by advances in artificial intelli-gence-has opened new possibilities across a wide range of fields, from healthcare to autonomous systems, by addressing critical data scarcity issues. However, this technological progress also brings with it a growing concern: the dual-use nature of synthetic data. While it offers powerful tools for innovation, it simultaneously introduces significant risks related to information disorder and cybersecurity. As AI systems become increasingly capable of producing highly realistic yet entirely fabricated content, the boundaries between authentic and artificial information blur, making it more difficult to detect manipulation, protect digital infrastructures, and maintain public trust. This work undertakes a preliminary exploration of the evolving nexus between Generative AI, Information Disorder, and Cybersecurity: it aims to investigate the complex interplay among these three and to map their dynamic interactions and reciprocal influences, highlighting both the potential benefits and the looming challenges posed by this evolving landscape. Moreover, it seeks to propose a conceptual framework for assessing these interdependencies through a set of indicative metrics, offering a foundation for future empirical evaluation and strategic response.  © 2025 IEEE.},

However, privacy-related limitations on data transfer from the edge to the cloud raise challenges: among various solutions, Federated Learning (FL) could satisfy privacy related concerns and accommodate power and energy issues of edge devices. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines FL and Ensemble Learning (EL) to improve both security and privacy challenges. The presented methodology introduces an extra layer, the Federation Layer, to enhance security. It uses Bayesian Networks (BNs) to dynamically filter untrusted/unsecure federation clients. This approach presents a solution for increasing the security and robustness of FL systems, considering also privacy and performance aspects. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

This work proposes a study focused on the Southern Italy regions, where environmental vulnerabilities are displayed, along with a limited availability of high-granularity data. The main aim of this work is to build and provide a comprehensive and detailed dataset tailored to the region’s unique needs, by leveraging datasets from EDGAR for greenhouse gases and air pollutants, integrated with demographic and territorial morphology data from ISTAT. The creation of composite indicators to monitor trends in emissions and pollution on a fine spatial scale is supported by the data set. These indicators enable initial insight into spatial disparities in pollutant concentrations, offering valuable data to inform targeted policy interventions. The work provided a foundation for next analytical studies, integrating different datasets and highlighting the potential for complex spatiotemporal analysis. The study provides a robust dataset and preliminary insights, enhancing the understanding of environmental dynamics in Southern Italy. Subsequent efforts will focus on extending this methodology to more extensive geographic contexts and incorporating real-time data for adaptive monitoring.

Health monitoring, domotics, Industry 4.0 and environmental challenges leverage the availability of cost-effective sensing solutions that allow both the creation of knowledge bases and the automatic process of them, be it with algorithmic approaches or artificial intelligence solutions. The foundation of these solutions is given by the Internet of Things (IoT), and the substanding Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology stack. Of course, design approaches are needed that enable defining efficient and effective sensing infrastructures, including energy related aspects. In this paper we present a Domain Specific Language for the design of energy aware WSN IoT solutions, that allows domain experts to define sensor network models that may be then analyzed by simulation-based or analytic techniques to evaluate the effect of task allocation and offioading and energy harvesting and utilization in the network.

Unfortunately, the literature reports that IoT devices, a widely adopted technology for these applications, are characterized by security vulnerabilities that are difficult to manage at the state level. Comparable problems exist for related technologies that leverage smartphones, such as contact tracing applications, and non-medical health monitoring devices. In analogous situations, these vulnerabilities may be exploited in the cyber domain to overload the crisis management systems with false alarms and to interfere with the interests of target countries, with consequences on their economy and their political equilibria.

	abstract = {This study presents an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to predict the performance of marine scrubbers used for sulfur dioxide (SO2) removal from marine diesel engine flue gases. Using an aggregated dataset from a roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) cargo ship equipped with an open-loop scrubber, combined with satellite data, the study constructs and evaluates multiple artificial intelligence models, including ensemble models, which were benchmarked against each other using standard regression metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE). Results achieve high accuracy R2>0.92 and offer insights for optimizing scrubber operations. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence models lack transparency. To overcome this problem, this research integrates post-hoc explainability techniques to elucidate the contributions of various features to model predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. The integration of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5) not only confirmed the consistency of feature importance rankings (e.g. seawater acidity level, SO2 inlet concentration, outlet temperature) but also aligned with the physical-chemical principles of SO2 absorption. Quantitative comparisons with theoretical expectations demonstrated the reliability of the XAI insights, enhancing both model transparency and interpretability. This can improve the current capability of designing scrubber units by defining more efficient and less expensive options for environmental regulation compliance. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Modern networking is moving towards exploitation of autonomic features into networks to reduce management effort and compensate the increasing complexity of network infrastructures, e.g. in large computing facilities such the data centers that support cloud services delivery. Autonomicity provides the possibility of reacting to anomalies in network traffic by recognizing them and applying administrator defined reactions without the need for human intervention, obtaining a quicker response and easier adaptation to network dynamics, and letting administrators focus on general system-wide policies, rather than on each component of the infrastructure. The process of defining proper policies may benefit from adopting model-based design cycles, to get an estimation of their effects. In this paper we propose a model-based analysis approach of a simple autonomic router, using Stochastic Petri Nets, to evaluate the behavior of given policies designed to react to traffic workloads. The approach allows a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the policy and is suitable to be used in the preliminary phases of the design cycle for a Software Defined Networks compliant router control plane. ©ECMS Mauro Iacono, Francesco Palmieri, Marco Gribaudo, Massimo Ficco (Editors).},

In healthcare, especially, where large amounts of quantitative and qualitative data are transferred to support studies and early diagnosis and monitoring of any diseases, potential security and privacy issues cannot be underestimated. Federated learning is an approach where privacy issues related to sensitive data management can be significantly reduced, due to the possibility to train algorithms without exchanging data. The main idea behind this approach is that learning models can be trained in a distributed way, where multiple devices or servers with decentralized data samples can provide their contributions without having to exchange their local data. Recent studies provided evidence that prototypes trained by adopting Federated Learning strategies are able to achieve reliable performance, thus by generating robust models without sharing data and, consequently, limiting the impact on security and privacy.

The increasing possibilities of acquiring and sharing personal information and data through digital devices and platforms, such as apps or social networks, have increased the risks of privacy breaches. In order to effectively respect and guarantee the privacy and protection of sensitive information, it is necessary to develop mechanisms capable of providing such guarantees automatically and reliably. In this paper we propose a methodology able to automatically recognize sensitive data. A Named Entity Recognition was used to identify appropriate entities. An improvement in the recognition of these entities is achieved by evaluating the words contained in an appropriate context window by assessing their similarity to words in a domain taxonomy. This, in fact, makes it possible to refine the labels of the recognized categories using a generic Named Entity Recognition. A preliminary evaluation of the reliability of the proposed approach was performed.

The study evaluates these models on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset, implementing the different classifiers with existing, well-assessed technologies. Given the fundamental differences in computational paradigms, performance assessment extends beyond traditional accuracy metrics to include computational efficiency, interpretability, and, for quantum models, gate depth and noise. As a summary of the results, the proposed Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) model achieves an accuracy of 75% on the target images classification task, indicating promising performance within current quantum computational limits. All the experiments strongly suggest that Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) exhibit increased accuracy as image resolution decreases, QCNN performance meaningfully changes in relation to noise level, while CNNs still keeping strong discriminative capabilities.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

In order to not develop strict measures and to better manage territories, the national authorities have applied a vast range of predictive models. Actually, the application of machine learning has been studied in the last decades in various cases with various declination to simplify this problem. In this paper, we apply a regression-based analysis technique to a dataset containing official historical local pollution and weather data to look for criteria that allow forecasting critical conditions. The methods was applied to the case study of Napoli, Italy, where the local environmental protection agency manages a set of fixed monitoring stations where both chemical and meteorological data are recorded. The joining of the two raw dataset was overcome by the use of a maximum inclusion strategy as performing the joining action with”outer” mode. Among the four different regression models applied, namely the Linear Regression Model calculated with Ordinary Least Square (LN-OLS), the Ridge regression Model (Ridge), the Lasso Model (Lasso) and Supervised Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), the Ridge regression model was found to better perform with an R2 (Coefficient of Determination) value equal to 0.77 and low value for both MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error), equal to 0.12 and 0.04 respectively. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen some impressive leaps, achieving the ability to accomplish several tasks, from text completion to powerful chatbots. The great variety of available LLMs and the fast pace of technological innovations in this field, is making LLM assessment a hard task to accomplish: understanding not only what such a kind of systems generate but also which is the quality of their results is of a paramount importance. Generally, the quality of a synthetically generated object could refer to the reliability of the content, to the lexical variety or coherence of the text. Regarding the quality of text generation, an aspect that up to now has not been adequately discussed is concerning the readability of textual artefacts. This work focuses on the latter aspect, proposing a set of experiments aiming to better understanding and evaluating the degree of readability of texts automatically generated by an LLM. The analysis is performed through an empirical study based on: considering a subset of five pre-trained LLMs; considering a pool of English text generation tasks, with increasing difficulty, assigned to each of the models; and, computing a set of the most popular readability indexes available from the computational linguistics literature. Readability indexes will be computed for each model to provide a first perspective of the readability of textual contents artificially generated can vary among different models and under different requirements of the users. The results obtained by evaluating and comparing different models provide interesting insights, especially into the responsible use of these tools by both beginners and not overly experienced practitioners. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The role of remote resources, such as the ones provided by Cloud infrastructures, is of paramount importance for the implementation of cost effective, yet reliable software systems to provide services to third parties. Cost effectiveness is a direct consequence of a correct estimation of resource usage, to be able to define a budget and estimate the right price to put own services on the market. Attacks that overload resources with non legitimate requests, being them explicit attacks or just malicious, non harmful resource engagements, may push the use of Cloud resources beyond estimation, causing additional costs, or unexpected energy usage, or a lower overall quality of services, so intrusion detection devices or firewalls are set to avoid undesired accesses. We propose the use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to setup a method for shaping request based attacks capable of reaching resources beyond defenses.

	abstract = {Misinformation and Fake News are hard to dislodge. According to experts on this phenomenon, to fight disinformation a less credulous public is needed; so, current AI techniques can support misleading information debunking, given the human tendency to believe “facts” that confirm biases. Much effort has been recently spent by the research community on this plague: several AI-based approaches for automatic detection and classification of Fake News have been proposed; unfortunately, Fake News producers have refined their ability in eluding automatic ML and DL-based detection systems. So, debunking false news represents an effective weapon to contrast the users’ reliance on false information. In this work, we propose a preliminary study aiming to approach the design of effective fake news debunking systems, harnessing two complementary federated approaches. We propose, firstly, a federation of independent classification systems to accomplish a debunking process, by applying a distributed consensus mechanism. Secondly, a federated learning task, involving several cooperating nodes, is accomplished, to obtain a unique merged model, including features of single participants models, trained on different and independent data fragments. This study is a preliminary work aiming to to point out the feasibility and the comparability of these proposed approaches, thus paving the way to an experimental campaign that will be performed on effective real data, thus providing an evidence for an effective and feasible model for detecting potential heterogeneous fake news. Debunking misleading information is mission critical to increase the awareness of facts on the part of news consumers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {A proper requirement definition phase is of a paramount importance in software engineering. It is the first and prime mean to realize efficient and reliable systems. System requirements are usually formulated and expressed in natural language, given its universality and ease of communication and writing. Unfortunately, natural language can be a source of ambiguity, complexity and omissions, which may cause system failures. Among the different approaches proposed by the software engineering community, Behavioural-Driven Development (BDD) is affirming as a valid, practical method to structure effective and non-ambiguous requirement specifications. The paper tackles with the problem of measuring requirements in BDD by assessing some traditional Natural Language Processing-related metrics with respect to a sample excerpt of requirement specification rewritten according to the BDD criteria. This preliminary assessment is made on the ERTMS-ETCS Level 3 case study whose specification, up to this date, is not managed by a standardisation body. The paper demonstrates the necessity of novel metrics able to cope with the BDD specification paradigms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being recently explored also to its application in supporting malicious activities and objects detection. Furthermore, NLP and Deep Learning have become targets of malicious attacks too. Very recent researches evidenced that adversarial attacks are able to affect also NLP tasks, in addition to the more popular adversarial attacks on deep learning systems for image processing tasks. More precisely, while small perturbations applied to the data set adopted for training typical NLP tasks (e.g., Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, etc..) could be easily recognized, models poisoning, performed by the means of altered data models, typically provided in the transfer learning phase to a deep neural networks (e.g., poisoning attacks by word embeddings), are harder to be detected. In this work, we preliminary explore the effectiveness of a poisoned word embeddings attack aimed at a deep neural network trained to accomplish a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. By adopting the NER case study, we aimed to analyze the severity of such a kind of attack to accuracy in recognizing the right classes for the given entities. Finally, this study represents a preliminary step to assess the impact and the vulnerabilities of some NLP systems we adopt in our research activities, and further investigating some potential mitigation strategies, in order to make these systems more resilient to data and models poisoning attacks. © 2021 The Authors.

Traditional patent assessment methods, relying on manual review and keyword-based searches, are increasingly inadequate for analyzing the complexity of emerging IoT technologies. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven methodology for patent evaluation that leverages Large Language Models and machine learning techniques to assess patent relevance and estimate future impact. Our framework integrates advanced Natural Language Processing techniques with structured patent metadata to establish a systematic approach to patent analysis. The methodology consists of three key components: (1) feature extraction from patent text using LLM embeddings and conventional NLP methods, (2) relevance classification and clustering to identify emerging technological trends, and (3) an initial formulation of impact estimation based on semantic similarity and citation patterns. While this study focuses primarily on defining the methodology, we include a minimal validation on a sample dataset to illustrate its feasibility and potential. The proposed approach lays the groundwork for a scalable, automated patent evaluation system, with future research directions aimed at refining impact prediction models and expanding empirical validation.

The study is based on the reconstruction of an extensive dataset from one-year continuous monitoring of the scrubber's performances and operating conditions. The dataset has been interpreted with a conventional analytical, physical-mathematical, model for absorbers' rating and its combination with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) one. First, the analytical model has been used to provide a deterministic mathematical framework for the interpretation and the prediction of the scrubber's performances in terms of absorbed SO2 molar flow and SO2 concentration at the scrubber exit. Then, data mining and AI techniques have been applied to develop an Artificial Neural Network able to predict the error between the actual SO2 concentration at the scrubber exit and the corresponding analytical model predictions. The final result is a combined model providing superior robustness and accuracy in the prediction of the scrubber performance while preserving a rationale for process design and operation. This interesting outcome suggests that the development of combined, or hybrid, Analytical/AI models can be a reliable and cost-effective way to improve chemical engineers' ability to design and control marine scrubbers, as well as other chemical equipment. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Modern environmental regulations require rigorous optimization of operations in process engineering to reduce waste, pollution, and risks while maximizing efficiency. However, the nature of chemical plants, which include components with non-linear behavior, challenges the use of consolidated tuning and control techniques. Instead, ad-hoc, self-adapting, and time-variant controls, with a balanced tuning of parameters at both the subsystem and system level, may be necessary. Needed computing processes may require significant resources and high performance systems, if managed by means of traditional approaches and with exact solution methods. In this regard, domain experts suggest instead the use of integrated techniques based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which include Explainable AI (XAI) and Trustworthy AI (TAI), which are unique in this industry and still in the early stages of development. To pave the way for a real-time, cost-effective solution for this problem, this paper proposes an AI-based approach to model the performance of a real chemical plant, i.e. a marine scrubber installed on a Ro-Ro ship. The study aims to investigate Machine Learning (ML) techniques which can be used to model such processes. Notably, this analysis is the first of its kind, at the best of the authors’ knowledge. Overall, the study highlights the potential of using ML-based techniques, to optimize environmental compliance in the shipping industry. © ECMS Enrico Vicario, Romeo Bandinelli, Virginia Fani, Michele Mastroianni (Editors) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: Voice analysis has significant potential in aiding healthcare professionals with detecting, diagnosing, and personalising treatment. It represents an objective and non-intrusive tool for supporting the detection and monitoring of specific pathologies. By calculating various acoustic features, voice analysis extracts valuable information to assess voice quality. The choice of these parameters is crucial for an accurate assessment. Method: In this paper, we propose a lightweight acoustic parameter set, named HEAR, able to evaluate voice quality to assess mental health. In detail, this consists of jitter, spectral centroid, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and their derivates. The choice of parameters for the proposed set was influenced by the explainable significance of each acoustic parameter in the voice production process. Results: The reliability of the proposed acoustic set to detect the early symptoms of mental disorders was evaluated in an experimental phase. Voices of subjects suffering from different mental pathologies, selected from available databases, were analysed. The performance obtained from the HEAR features was compared with that obtained by analysing features selected from toolkits widely used in the literature, as with those obtained using learned procedures. The best performance in terms of MAE and RMSE was achieved for the detection of depression (5.32 and 6.24 respectively). For the detection of psychogenic dysphonia and anxiety, the highest accuracy rates were about 75 % and 97 %, respectively. Conclusions: The comparative evaluation was carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach, demonstrating a reliable capability to highlight affective physiological alterations of voice quality due to the considered mental disorders. © 2024 The Author(s)},

The temperature sensing subsystem relies on Mobotix thermal camera without the black body, the automatic compensation subsystem relies on Raspberry Pi with Node-RED and TensorFlow 2.x. The final results showed that it is possible to automatically calibrate the camera using machine learning and that it is possible to use thermal imaging cameras even in critical conditions such as outdoors. Future development is to improve performance using computer vision techniques to rule out irrelevant measurements. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {Authorship Attribution (AA) is currently applied in several applications, among which fraud detection and anti-plagiarism checks: this task can leverage stylometry and Natural Language Processing techniques. In this work, we explored some strategies to enhance the performance of an AA task for the automatic detection of false and misleading information (e.g., fake news). We set up a text classification model for AA based on stylometry exploiting recurrent deep neural networks and implemented two learning tasks trained on the same collection of fake and real news, comparing their performances: one is based on Federated Learning architecture, the other on a centralized architecture. The goal was to discriminate potential fake information from true ones when the fake news comes from heterogeneous sources, with different styles. Preliminary experiments show that a distributed approach significantly improves recall with respect to the centralized model. As expected, precision was lower in the distributed model. This aspect, coupled with the statistical heterogeneity of data, represents some open issues that will be further investigated in future work. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-changing technology that is having a profound impact on our society, from education to industry. Its applications cover a wide range of areas, such as medicine, military, engineering and research. The emergence of AI and Generative AI have significant potential to transform society, but they also raise concerns about transparency, privacy, ownership, fair use, reliability, and ethical considerations. The Generative AI adds complexity to the existing problems of AI due to its ability to create machine-generated data that is barely distinguishable from human-generated data. Bringing to the forefront the issue of responsible and fair use of AI. The security, safety and privacy implications are enormous, and the risks associated with inappropriate use of these technologies are real. Although some governments, such as the European Union and the United States, have begun to address the problem with recommendations and proposed regulations, it is probably not enough. Regulatory compliance should be seen as a starting point in a continuous process of improving the ethical procedures and privacy risk assessment of AI systems. The need to have a baseline to manage the process of creating an AI system even from an ethics and privacy perspective becomes progressively more important In this study, we discuss the ethical implications of these advances and propose a conceptual framework for the responsible, fair, and safe use of AI. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

Disposable intelligent wireless sensors, capable of processing tasks locally, are deployed and used to support and protect the intervention of a squad of firemen equipped with augmented reality and life monitoring devices to provide an environmental monitoring system and communication infrastructure,in the framework of a next-generation, cloud-supported emergency management system.

	abstract = {Complexity of current computer networks, including e.g., local networks, large structured networks, wireless sensor networks, datacenter backbones, requires a thorough study to perform analysis and support design. Simulation is a tool of paramount importance to encompass all the different aspects that contribute to design quality and network performance (including as well energy issues, security management overheads, dependability), due to the fact that such complexity produces several interactions at all network layers that is not easily modellable with analytic approaches. In this systematic literature review we aim to analyze, basing our investigation on available literature, the adoption of a popular network simulator, namely ns-3, and its use in the scientific community. More in detail, we are interested in understanding what are the impacted application domains in which authors prefer ns-3 to other similar tools and how extensible it is in practice according to the experience of authors. The results of our analysis, which has been conducted by especially focusing on 128 papers published between 2009 to 2019, reveals that 10% of the evaluated papers were discarded because they represented informal literature; most of the studies presented comparisons among different network simulators, beyond ns-3 and conceptual studies related to performance assessment and validation and routing protocols. Only about 30% of considered studies present extensions of ns-3 in terms of new modules and only about 10% present effective case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of employing network simulator in real application, except conceptual and modeling studies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been swiftly incorporated into the industry to become a part of both customer services and manufacturing operations. To effectively address the ethical issues now being examined by the government, AI models must be explainable in order to be used in both scientific and societal contexts. The current state of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in process engineering is examined in this study through a systematic literature review (SLR), with particular attention paid to the technology’s effect, degree of adoption, and potential to improve process and product quality. Due to restricted access to sizable, reliable datasets, XAI research in process engineering is still primarily exploratory or propositional, despite noteworthy applicability in well-known case studies. According to our research, XAI is becoming more and more positioned as a tool for decision support, with a focus on robustness and dependability in process optimization, maintenance, and quality assurance. This study, however, emphasizes that the use of XAI in process engineering is still in its early stages, and there is significant potential for methodological development and wider use across technical domains. © 2024 by the authors.},

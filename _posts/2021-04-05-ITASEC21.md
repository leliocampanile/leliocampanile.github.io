The Italian Conference on CyberSecurity ([ITASEC](https://itasec.it))  is an annual event supported and organized by the Cybersecurity National Laboratory.

The 2021 edition will be an all-digital conference from April 7th to April 9th, 2021. 

During this conference there will be a panel on gender divisions in the IT sector, thanks to an event coordinated by the CyberEquality working group (of which I am a member) of the National Cybersecurity Laboratory, created in 2020 to identify and develop targeted initiatives on the topic. The panel will take place on Friday 9 April from [15.30-16.30](https://2021.itasec.it/session/15).The panel will be in italian and participation is free. If you can, please participate and spread the word.

I‚Äôm pleased to announce that our **Special Session AI4EIoT-2026** on *Artificial Intelligence for Emerging IoT Systems*  
has been officially accepted at **IoTBDS 2026**, which will take place in **Benidorm, Spain, from May 21‚Äì23, 2026**.

This new edition continues the tradition of the previous AI4IoT sessions (2020‚Äì2025),  
expanding its focus to include **LLMs, Explainable AI, and Generative AI** for the design of **trustworthy, scalable, and domain-aware IoT systems**.

##  Scope

The Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving into a pervasive, intelligent, and interconnected ecosystem where data-driven AI enables adaptive, secure, and sustainable decision-making.  
Artificial Intelligence ‚Äî including **Deep Learning**, **Explainable and Trustworthy AI**, and more recently **Large Language Models (LLMs)** ‚Äî is transforming the design and operation of IoT and **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**, enabling distributed intelligence at the edge, in the cloud, and across hybrid environments.

This special session aims to explore **emerging challenges, opportunities, and methodologies** at the intersection of AI and IoT, focusing on **trustworthiness, scalability, sustainability, and cross-domain applicability**.  
Particular attention is given to **federated and edge learning**, **energy-efficient AI**, **XAI**, and the role of **LLMs and Generative AI** in making IoT systems more adaptive, explainable, and capable of simulating real-world processes.

We also encourage submissions from **industrial, civil, and process engineering domains**, where AI-enhanced IoT is revolutionizing monitoring, control, and predictive maintenance.

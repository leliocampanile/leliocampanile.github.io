Generated on 2025-10-04

This plan outlines a sustainable, high–impact publication strategy for the next four months — combining technical notes, methodological insights, tool showcases, and concise guides.

## 🧩 Technical Notes

### **October (Week 2)** — *Building a Reproducible Python Environment for Research and Teaching*
A guide to creating reproducible Python environments across macOS and Linux using `pyenv`, `uv`, and `poetry`. Focus on version management, caching, and cross-device workflows (Mac ↔ iPad).

### **December (Week 2)** — *From Mac to Cloud: Using GitHub Actions for Reproducible Jekyll Workflows*
Step-by-step guide to automating Academic Pages builds and deployment via GitHub Actions. Includes caching, dependency management, and Python+Ruby integration.

---

## 📊 Tools & Frameworks

### **October (Week 4)** — *Inside SHIELD: Evaluating AI Text Detection Through Ensemble Learning*
Overview of the SHIELD architecture, ensemble learning strategies, and reliability analysis. Discusses false positives, interpretability, and model robustness.

### **December (Week 4)** — *LLMTextCrafter: Stylometric Evaluation of Language Models*
Presentation of the LLMTextCrafter tool — a stylometric evaluation pipeline combining text generation, Burrows’ Delta, and cross-model stylistic comparison.

---

## 🔍 Mini Guides

### **November (Week 2)** — *Using SimPy for Discrete-Event Simulation: from Queue Models to Edge–Blockchain Systems*
Hands-on tutorial introducing SimPy for event-driven modeling, including queue systems and distributed blockchain-based infrastructures.

### **January (Week 2)** — *Working with HuggingFace Models Locally: From Fine-Tuning to Evaluation*
Short guide to running and evaluating HuggingFace models on Apple Silicon or CPU environments, covering local inference, lightweight fine-tuning, and metrics.

---

## 🧪 Research Insights

### **November (Week 4)** — *Beyond Accuracy: Quantitative Evaluation of Trust and Privacy in AI Systems*
Methodological reflection on how to measure non-functional attributes — interpretability, fairness, and privacy leakage — in modern AI pipelines.

### **January (Week 4)** — *Performance Evaluation as a Scientific Bridge: From Simulation to Explainable AI*
Meta-scientific piece summarizing the unifying thread of your research (evaluation and modeling) across AI, systems, and privacy.

## 🔁 Cross-Posting Strategy

- **Primary:** Academic Pages blog (Markdown, full version).  
- **Secondary:** Medium (shortened with backlink).  
- **Social:**  
  - *LinkedIn* — 3–5 line teaser + image + link.  
  - *X (Twitter)* — title + 1 line insight + #AIResearch #EdgeComputing #XAI.  

---

## 🧠 Workflow Tips

- Maintain two active drafts in `_drafts/` to keep momentum.  
- Each article follows the pattern: *context → example → reflection → takeaway*.  
- Reuse post material for Deckset slides or academic talks.  
- Use `post-summary.yaml` to track ideas, progress, and publication dates.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Create `_drafts/2025-10-15-reproducible-python-env.md`.  
2. Add a placeholder image in `assets/images/posts/python-env/`.  
3. Prepare cross-post template for Medium.  
4. Schedule LinkedIn teaser publication (manual or via Buffer).  
5. Review SHIELD and LLMTextCrafter documentation for December posts.
